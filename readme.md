# Udacity FEND Neighborhbood Map Project

 This Application shows in my opinion the 10 best breweries Michigan has to offer.  It includes a search function, a clickable list, and a map of the locations.
 It also incorporates the Wikipedia API for more information on each brewery.


## How To Use

1. Open the index.html file in a browser, or on a local server.

2. When the list on the left is clicked, the infowindow will show information about each brewery from Wikipedia.

3. If a marker is clicked an infowindow will display the name of the brewery and also the website url.

4. To search for a specific brewery, you can type the name in the search bar and only the brewery you have searched for will be displayed.
